                This website was created to analyze videos with a focus on
                enhancing accessibility awareness for a wide range of users,
                including game developers and content creators. It assesses
                videos based on three key aspects of accessibility:
                Seizure-Inducing Flashing, Blue Light Impact, and Luminance
                Levels.
                <br />
                <br />
                RGB values are taken from each frame of the video. Then the tool
                figures out what percentage of the pixels in each frame fall
                into the hue range of harmful blue light. Next, it calculates
                the overall luminance value of each frame using the RGB values.
                It finds areas with excessive luminance values. Finally, it
                compares luminance values of each frame looking for changes
                large enough to be considered a flash. If it finds three flashes
                in a second. Then, that area of the video could potentially
                trigger a photosensitive seizure. By addressing these aspects,
                the website aims to make videos more inclusive and considerate
                of diverse user needs.
